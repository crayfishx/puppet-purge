  @doc=(<<-EOT)
  This is a metatype to purge resources from the agent.  When run without
  parameters the purge type takes a resource type as a title.  The
  resource type must be one that has a provider that supports the instances
  method (eg: package, user, yumrepo).  Any instances of the resource found
  on the agent that are *not* in the catalog will be purged.

  You can also add filter conditions to control the behaviour of purge
  using the if and unless parameters.

  Eg:
  To remove *all* users found on the system that are not present in the
  catalog (caution!):

   purge { 'user': }

  To remove all users found on the system but not in the catalog, unless
  the user has a UID below 500:

   purge { 'user':
    unless => [ 'uid', '<=', '500' ],
   }
